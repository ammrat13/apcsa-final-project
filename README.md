An interactive plotter for complex-valued functions of complex numbers

# Description
This program allows you to plot complex functions. Complex numbers can be colored, and this program leverages this fact. The plot area will, when a function is put in, color each point in the plot area (whose bounds are set by the text boxes around the plot area) the color of its corresponding output. For example, if the function is *f(z) = 2z + 3*, the point corresponding to *1+i* will be colored the color corresponding to *5+2i*. You can also click on the plot area and drag your mouse to see how the output, marked by a green dot, changes with input, marked by a red dot where you clicked. Details about the input and output are displayed on the left hand side.
